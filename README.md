My dear Diary,

today(10.02.2021) Stefan teached us the first few things from data bases.
The first exercise was to create a Entity Relationship model with Entity, Relationship and attributes (ER-model-Chen notation).
He showed us some data types like (int, varchar, Date and Binary) in MYSQL.

In Love Sebastian <3
